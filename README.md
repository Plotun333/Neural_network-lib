# This is a Neural network library

## Created thanks to
* ### [CodinTrain](https://thecodingtrain.com/)

## This library also contains
* ### matrix library
* ### backpropagation
   * Xor example
* ### Genetic algorthm
    * cross_over
    * mutate

## Key functions
* ### train() - input is input array and target array
* ### feed_forward() - input is a input array


### this library is impelmented in my [Snake_nn](https://github.com/Plotun333/Snake_nn) project 


## What did I learn
* ### how to work with deep neural network and multylayered neuralnetworks
* ### how to work with a matrix
* ### how to create functions for genetic algorthms
* ### how to work with backpropagation
